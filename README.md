# GraduateWork

The work within this repository is the culmination of all my work throughout my Graduate program.
Although I didn't work on information technology projects until my second year, I believe 
that these projects show a large amount of growth from never programming before.

With that being said, I am thoroughly passionate about visuals and visualizing 
all the analysis I have conducted throughout the semester.
